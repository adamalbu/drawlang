Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . program
    (1) program -> . program command
    (2) program -> . command
    (3) command -> . PAINT expression

    PAINT           shift and go to state 3

    program                        shift and go to state 1
    command                        shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (0) S' -> program .
    (1) program -> program . command
    (3) command -> . PAINT expression

    PAINT           shift and go to state 3

    command                        shift and go to state 4

state 2

    (2) program -> command .

    PAINT           reduce using rule 2 (program -> command .)
    $end            reduce using rule 2 (program -> command .)


state 3

    (3) command -> PAINT . expression
    (4) expression -> . STRING

    STRING          shift and go to state 6

    expression                     shift and go to state 5

state 4

    (1) program -> program command .

    PAINT           reduce using rule 1 (program -> program command .)
    $end            reduce using rule 1 (program -> program command .)


state 5

    (3) command -> PAINT expression .

    PAINT           reduce using rule 3 (command -> PAINT expression .)
    $end            reduce using rule 3 (command -> PAINT expression .)


state 6

    (4) expression -> STRING .

    PAINT           reduce using rule 4 (expression -> STRING .)
    $end            reduce using rule 4 (expression -> STRING .)
