Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> program
Rule 1     program -> command
Rule 2     command -> PAINT expression
Rule 3     expression -> STRING

Terminals, with rules where they appear

EQUALS               : 
ID                   : 
NEWLINE              : 
PAINT                : 2
STRING               : 3
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

command              : 1
expression           : 2
program              : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . program
    (1) program -> . command
    (2) command -> . PAINT expression

    PAINT           shift and go to state 3

    program                        shift and go to state 1
    command                        shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (0) S' -> program .



state 2

    (1) program -> command .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (program -> command .)


state 3

    (2) command -> PAINT . expression
    (3) expression -> . STRING

    STRING          shift and go to state 5

    expression                     shift and go to state 4

state 4

    (2) command -> PAINT expression .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (command -> PAINT expression .)


state 5

    (3) expression -> STRING .

    $end            reduce using rule 3 (expression -> STRING .)
